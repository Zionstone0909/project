        IYN, which stand for impact Youth network was established in the year 2017 by Pastor Goodluck .A. David<br> Establishing a powerful military force requires not only the construction of a formidable army but also the meticulous cultivation of individuals, focusing on the development and enhancement of their capacities and capabilities.Biblically, the concept of building a mighty army and developing individuals to enhance their capacities can be reflected in various passages that emphasize strength, preparation, and the nurturing of human potential.

        One might draw inspiration from verses that highlight the importance of equipping individuals with the virtues of courage, wisdom, and resilience. Proverbs 24:5-6, for example, encourages strategic planning and preparedness: "A wise man is full of strength, and a man of knowledge enhances his might, for by wise guidance you can wage your war, and in abundance of counselors there is victory."
        
        Furthermore, passages like Ephesians 6:10-18 provide an analogy of spiritual armor, illustrating the importance of being well-prepared and fortified: "Finally, be strong in the Lord and in his mighty power. Put on the full armor of God so that you can take your stand against the devilâ€™s schemes."
        
        In a broader sense, biblical teachings often emphasize the development of character, integrity, and faith, which are essential elements in building a mighty force. Proverbs 20:29 states, "The glory of young men is their strength, gray hair the splendor of the old." This implies a continuum of strength and wisdom passed through generations.
        
        Therefore, building a mighty army biblically involves not only the physical aspects but also the spiritual and moral development of individuals, fostering qualities that contribute to strength, resilience, and righteousness.
